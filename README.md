# Objective 1
- Polygon class is created that takes in number of edges and circumradius as input.
- Property decorator is used for functions to get properties like
  - interior angle
  - edge length
  - apothem
  - area
  - perimeter
- To get the functionalities
  __repr__, __eq__ and __gt__ function is overwritten.


# Objective 2
- A custom polygon sequence is written. The input to which is a number of vertices for largest polygon and common circumradius.
- Properties dectorator is used for function max_efficiency_polygon. This function returns highest area:perimeter ratio.
- functionalities are also added as specified in the assignment.
